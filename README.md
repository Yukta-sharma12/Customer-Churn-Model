<h1>Project Overview</h1>
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to classify customers of a subscription-based service by their risk of churning—i.e., discontinuing their subscription. By analyzing customer data, the project aims to uncover key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to help businesses improve retention. With this model, businesses can identify customers at risk of leaving early, enabling targeted retention strategies that reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The core objectives of this project are:

#Predict Customer Churn: Build a model that classifies customers as either high-risk or low-risk for churn.

#Identify Key Churn Drivers: Pinpoint important factors (such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and engagement) that are most associated with churn.

#Provide Actionable Insights: Deliver insights on customer behavior that can help businesses develop effective retention strategies and preemptively address the needs of at-risk customers.

#Technologies Used

#Programming Language: Python

<h2>Libraries</h2>

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Efficient numerical operations.

matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization for EDA and model insights.

scikit-learn (sklearn): Building machine learning models, data preprocessing, and evaluation.

tensorflow: For building and training neural network models.

<h2>Data Description</h2>
The dataset represents customer information from a subscription-based service. Each row corresponds to a customer, and the dataset includes various demographic and service-related attributes that could influence churn:

Demographic Attributes: Gender, SeniorCitizen status, Partner status, Dependents.
Service Usage Attributes: Tenure (months of service), PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService type, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, and StreamingMovies.
Contract & Billing Attributes: Contract type, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges.
Churn Indicator: The target variable (Yes/No) indicating if the customer has churned.
<h2>Approach</h2>
#1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures data consistency, cleanliness, and readiness for model training. Key preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: For instance, the TotalCharges column, which may contain missing or non-numeric values, should be cleaned and converted to numerical data.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Transform categorical variables (like gender, partner status, and payment method) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding, making them suitable for model input.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical variables (e.g., MonthlyCharges, Tenure) to ensure they’re on a comparable scale, which helps certain algorithms perform better.

#2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, laying the groundwork for feature selection and hypothesis generation.

Visualize Distributions and Relationships: Plot the distribution of key variables to see how customer segments differ and how churn varies across demographics and service types.
Analyze Correlations: Identify correlations between features and churn, which will provide initial insights into which variables are strong predictors of churn. Techniques include correlation heatmaps and pair plots.
Churn Analysis: Understand churn behavior within different customer segments, such as examining churn rates by contract type, tenure, or internet service type, which can reveal high-risk groups.

#3. Model Development
This stage involves training multiple machine learning models and selecting the best one for predicting churn. Key steps include:

Model Selection: Train various algorithms, each with unique strengths in handling different data types and patterns:
Logistic Regression: A baseline model for binary classification and interpretability.
Decision Trees & Random Forests: Capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Often provides superior predictive power with strong control over model complexity.
Neural Networks: Implemented with TensorFlow, to capture complex patterns in larger datasets.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.

#4. Model Evaluation
Evaluation measures the model's effectiveness and reliability in predicting churn.

Metrics: Assess model performance using relevant classification metrics:
Accuracy: Overall proportion of correctly classified cases.
Precision, Recall, and F1-score: Metrics especially useful for handling class imbalance.
ROC-AUC: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, giving an overall view of performance.
Confusion Matrix Analysis: Examine false positives and false negatives, which can be particularly important in understanding the potential costs of misclassification in a business context.
Feature Importance Analysis: Using techniques like SHAP values (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or feature importance plots for tree-based models to identify the most influential factors on churn.

#5. Results and Insights
This step involves summarizing the model’s performance and deriving actionable insights based on the model's predictions and feature analysis:

Model Performance Summary: Present an overview of how each model performed on the test set, highlighting the final selected model.
Churn Drivers: Key factors influencing churn, identified from feature importance and SHAP analysis, could include variables like contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and internet service type.
Actionable Recommendations: Based on the factors identified, suggest strategies to improve retention. For instance:
Flexible Contracts: Since monthly contract customers may have higher churn rates, consider incentives to convert them to long-term contracts.
Customer Engagement: Improve customer engagement through value-added services like tech support or bundled services to retain high-risk customers.
Final Deliverables
The final deliverables of this project include:

<h2>Predictive Model</h2> A trained and validated model that can classify customers as high-risk or low-risk for churn.
Feature Insights: A report on the key drivers of churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.
Retention Recommendations: Data-driven insights for customer retention strategies that the business can implement.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in predicting customer behavior. By understanding and predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and enhance their overall strategy. The model developed can serve as a valuable tool for subscription-based services looking to improve customer retention and satisfaction.
